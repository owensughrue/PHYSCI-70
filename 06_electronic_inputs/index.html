<h4> Part I: Measuring Capacitance Between Copper Plates </h4>

The first part of this week's project asked us to "make a capacitive sensor to measure a physical quantity with your microcontroller." Given what we learned about capacitance during this week's classes and readings, we learned how to use a breadboard, copper plates, alligator wires, and Arduino to measure the capacitance between two copper plates. Thank you very much to Gabby Perry and Kassia Love for helping me with this aspect of the week's project. <br>
<br>

<h4> Initial Trial </h4>

It might be best to show the picture of the circuit and then explain below. Here is a picture of the circuit on the breadboard and connected to the microcontroller. Thank you to [this website](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_img_width.asp) for the code for inserting this image and helping me get the desired dimensions for this image. <br>

What I first tried when setting up this circuit was connecting the a wire from the 5V pin in the microcontroller to one of the Power Rails of the breadboard and a GND pin in the microcontroller to the other Power Rail of the breadboard on the other side. Then, I connected a resistor from the Power Rail shared with power across to a terminal strip. I then attached a wire just beyond this resistor along the same terminal strip as the resistor, with one end down into the breadboard and the other well above with one end of the alligator wires attached. (Attached to the other end of those alligator wires was the copper plate.) Then, I connected a wire from the A3 pin of the microcontroller to the same terminal strip as the resistor and the wire attached to the alligator strips (before the Center Divider of the breadboard). <br>

Then, I attached another resistor from that side of the breadboard all the way across the Center Divider and the terminal strip of the other side to the Power Rail on the opposite side, on the same vertical strip as the wire connected to the GND pin on the microcontroller. Thank you to [this website](https://learn.adafruit.com/breadboards-for-beginners?view=all) for explaining the components of a breadboard: Power Rails, Terminal Strips, and Center Divider. <br>

Additionally, here is the Arduino code for this program. I mention it in a comment, but thank you very much to Robert Hart for supplying this code. I used the code from [this website](https://roberthart56.github.io/SCFAB/SC_lab/Sensors/tx_rx_sensors/rx_tx03.txt) for this part of the assignment.

Here is a video of using this circuit and the serial plotter in Arduino Notice the peaks in the graph when moving the copper plates closer together; the capacitance is highest when the plates are closest together and touching over the most area: <br>

<h4> A More Efficient Approach </h4>

So, there were a lot of positives with this circuit—most notably, it worked! However, Gabby explained to me several of the components of the circuit and I went through the code with both Gabby and Kassia during their office hours. When discussing the code with Kassia, we were talking about the <code> analog_pin =A3</code> variable and the <code> tx_pin = A1</code> variable. So, in fiddling with the circuit a bit, Kassia helped me see that the <code> analog_pin =A3</code> was instructing the Arduino to read the information from the A3 pin and the <code> tx_pin = A1</code> was providing something (another copper plate) with which the <code>A3</code> could read the capacitance between the two plates and send that information to the serial plotter in Arduino. <br>
So with this information, we experimented with directly connecting one of the ends of the alligator wires to the A1 pin in the microcontroller and another end of another of the alligator wires into the A3 pin of the microcontroller. It turns out that this worked as well—no breadboard needed!

Here is an image of the breadboard-less setup.

Additionally, here is a video of the serial plot of the capacitance between the two copper plates on the Arduino (You can notice at the end when I hold the plates against each other such that they are touching together across a lot of surface area; capacitance increases the closer the plates are together and the more surface area both plates have to touch each other):

<h4> Part II: Setting up a Microphone with Arduino </h4>

Thank you to Nathan Melenbrink and [this website](https://nathanmelenbrink.github.io/ps70/06_input/mic/index.html) for guiding me through this assignment. This website gave me the foundational ideas and steps for completeing this part of this week's project. <br>

To set up the microphone, the website explains that you can connect a wire from the GND pin in the microcontroller to the GND pin in the microphone, a wire from the 5V pin in the microcontroller to the Vin pin in the microphone, and a wire from an analogue reading pin in the microcontroller (A0) to the DC pin in the microphone. To do this, we can connect the other end of the pins connected to the microcontroller into a breadboard and connect the microphone to the breadboard, as seen below. I found that the problem with this setup was that my microphone wasn't connected well enough to the pins and the serial plotter didn't work like I'd hoped. <br>
Here is the setup of what everything looked like. You can notice the microphone leaning back because the pins weren't soddered on.

So, given that the results weren't working as well as I'd hoped with this setup, Gabby helped me to connect the wires and the microphone directly. Gabby showed me that we could still connect wires from the microcontroller to the breadboard, but rather than have the microphone connected to the breadboard as well, we could connect two wires on the same Power Rails as the two wires connected to GND and 5V in the microcontroller to the pins in the microphone, as shown below.

When reconstructing this setup to make the circuit to capture on video, I tried to recreate what I'd seen Gabby illustrate, but, this time, connected the wires directly from the microcontroller to the microphone. A picture of this new setup (not connected to a power source (my computer)) is below.

<img src="microphone_breadboardless_setup.png"
alt="Microphone Breadboard-Less Setup"
width="720" height="480">

This new setup worked just fine! It makes total sense, thinking about how rather than connecting the wires from the microcontroller to the breaboard to the microphone, we can connect the wires directly from the microcontroller to the microphone! Very similar to what Kassia explained in helping me with the circuit to measure the capacitance between the copper plates, connecting wires directly from the microcontroller to what we're measuring yields good results. <br>
In this setup, we can connect a wire from the GND pin of the microcontroller (directly) to the GND pin of the microphone, a wire from the 5V pin of the microcontroller (directly) to the Vin pin of the microphone, and a wire from the A0 pin (directly) to the DC pin of the microphone. I found this was just a different way to set up the circuit and seemed to work well.
Here is a video of the serial plotter in Arduino reading information from the microphone.

The code I used came from [this website](https://nathanmelenbrink.github.io/ps70/06_input/mic/index.html) and is below:

<code>
      const int sampleWindow = 50; // Sample window width in mS (50 mS = 20Hz) <br>
    unsigned int sample; <br>
<br>
    void setup() <br>
    { <br>
       Serial.begin(9600); <br>
    } <br>
    <br>
    void loop() <br>
    { <br>
       unsigned long startMillis= millis();  // Start of sample window<br>
       unsigned int peakToPeak = 0;   // peak-to-peak level<br>
<br>
       unsigned int signalMax = 0;<br>
       unsigned int signalMin = 1024;<br>
<br>
       // collect data for 50 mS<br>
       while (millis() - startMillis < sampleWindow)<br>
       {<br>
          sample = analogRead(0);   //reading DC pin from pin A0<br>
          if (sample < 1024)  // toss out spurious readings<br>
          {<br>
             if (sample > signalMax)<br>
             {<br>
                signalMax = sample;  // save just the max levels<br>
             }<br>
             else if (sample < signalMin)<br>
             {<br>
                signalMin = sample;  // save just the min levels<br>
             } <br>
          } <br>
       } <br>
       peakToPeak = signalMax - signalMin;  // max - min = peak-peak amplitude<br>
<br>
       Serial.println(peakToPeak);<br>
    }</code>
