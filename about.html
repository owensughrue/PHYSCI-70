  ### About Me:

  My name is Owen Sughrue and I am a junior at Harvard living in Leverett House. I am concentrating in psychology and am especially interested in social and performance psychology. I enjoy spending time with my family back in Marion, MA. I love tennis, golf, all Boston sports, and enjoy Formula 1 after watching Drive to Survive!
