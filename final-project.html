### Final Project Proposal:

In my final project, I plan to build a tool that can help people spread pizza sauce evenly on their homemade pizza. Though many restaurants have proper tools to ensure that chefs can evenly spread the sauce on their pizzas, the tool I plan to build could help people who are making their pizza at home, not requiring them to have other restaurant-quality cooking equipment. Given that the pandemic has prompted people to learn how to make foods and other items that they may have bought previously, my hope is that this can make the prospect of making pizza at home more enjoyable for those who choose to cook in their homes. I have seen an industrial type machine that spreads pizza evenly, but none designed for in-home, more personal use. <br>
<br>
The way I envision the tool working is that there is a center pole with a rotating wing that goes around in a circle spreading the sauce. The center pole goes in the middle of the pizza and the wing that circles around has an adjustable end, which users can adjust to fit the size of their pizza. To enusre that the pizza sauce does not go wider than intended, the end of the wing is bent to limit the edge of the circle to the desired circumference. Users can put a certain amount of sauce in front of the wing and then turn the tool on, starting the spread of the pizza around the dough, letting it spread until even across the pizza.<br>
<br>
I would like the center pole to be as small as possible to ensure that people can spread the sauce around the maximum area of the pizza with as little need to spread the middle as possible. Ideally, I would like to build an attachment to the center pole to make the tool taller and adjustable to whatever one is spreading, such as frosting on a three layer cake. <br>

Here is a simple diagram of what I envision for the tool:
