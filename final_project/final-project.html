<h1> Final Project Proposal: </h1>



<h2> Wind Compass </h2>

After going through the semester, I've decided that I'd like to make a wind compass for my final project. My hometown (Marion, MA) is near the ocean and Buzzards Bay. It is nearly always windy. I don't sail, but I do like to know the direction from which the wind is coming; the southwest breezes of the summer and the northwest winds of the winter feel quite different! My thinking is that a small-scale wind compass could help sailers or others who need to know the direction of the wind. <br>

For my project, I'm first building a compass, following [this tutorial](https://www.brainy-bits.com/post/build-an-arduino-rgb-led-ring-compass). As you can see in the image below, the compass has a string of LEDs, with the red LED indicating north. Thankfully, given the N, E, S, W orientation of direction, having only one direction is sufficient for knowing the other directions, too. Additionally, the box has the 5883-L module which helps with making compasses using Arduino. <br>

<h4> Factoring in the Wind </h4>

Given that compass has a box, I will insert a wind vein through the circle of LED lights. Looking at the box from above, it will be clear both which direction is north and which direction the wind is blowing. <br>

<h2> Starting the Project </h2>

<h4> Making Connections: Soldering Wires onto Pins in the HMC-5883L Module and Circle of LEDs </h4>

First, I wanted to get the compass up and working, so I could figure out the best way to orient the parts and make a box and wind vein to fit the parts needed for the compass (microcontroller, battery holder, HMC-5883L module, circle of LEDs, and wires) rather than fitting the comass parts to the box. The very first step was soddering on the wires to the HMC-5883L module and the circle of LEDs. Here's the picture of the connections from the Brainy Bits page: <br>

I soldered on wires to the pins of the HMC-5883L module and circle of LEDs that I'd need to connect to the microcontroller for the compass. <br>

Here's a picture of the soldered wires onto the HMC-5883L module: <br>

I'm definitely not the best solderer in the world. Thank you to Gabby for her help with soldering methods, and with desoldering using the copper braid! I originally had too much solder on some of the connections for the circle of LEDs and used the desoldering braid to remove some of the excess so the connections wouldn't be off. Having learned my lesson with the circle of LEDs, I used less solder for the HMC-5883L module, doing my best to ensure that none of the soldering material used to connect the pins connected to any other pins' soldering material. <br>

As a quick side note and illustration of what *not* to do when soldering, below is a picture of one of my attempts from a project earlier this semester. Ibrahim very kindly explained at the time that my soldering "could be improved." Knowing what I know now, sheesh! It sure could! The problem with these connections was that the soldering metal from one pin to another was totally connected so the jumper wires that were meant to connect to specific pins weren't distinctly connected; everything sort of was connected to everything else, which would make the circuit a bit of a mess! <br>

<b> Again, what *not* to do! :) </b> <br>

Given that I'd be putting the wires inside of a box and likely moving things around, I wanted to make sure I had some flexibility with the wires. While the wires I'd used initially to link the circle of LEDs and the HMC-5883L module with the microcontroller were totally fine, the wires were a little bit stiff and I just wanted to have some flexibility, especially because I thought I'd be moving them around. To do that, I kept the soldered parts of those wires attached to the circle of LEDs and the HMC-5883L, but snipped the wires much closer to both of those tools and attached a female-male jumper wire to those wires. I chose those wires because they're quite a bit looser and less stiff than the wires I'd used before. This new method would give me some flexibility. <br>

Here are some pictures of the new wires attached to the LEDs and HMC-5883L:

width="720" height="480"> <br>

Once the wires were properly soldered onto both the circle of LEDs and the HMC-5883L module, I tried to get the compass up and running. I was having a lot of trouble with the calibration process. I kept getting completely different calibration numbers when trying to calibrate the compass. Something seemed off, because whenever I'd move the compass around, the LEDs would move in the direction I was moving the compass, rather than staying in place (as they were supposed to continue to point north). <br>

Here's a video showing what I'm talking about with the LEDs:

### For Fun: Idea #1 (Not My Actual Final Project): Pizza Spreader

<h4> My original Final Project proposal from the first week of class </h4>

In my final project, I plan to build a tool that can help people spread pizza sauce evenly on their homemade pizza. Though many restaurants have proper tools to ensure that chefs can evenly spread the sauce on their pizzas, the tool I plan to build could help people who are making their pizza at home, not requiring them to have other restaurant-quality cooking equipment. Given that the pandemic has prompted people to learn how to make foods and other items that they may have bought previously, my hope is that this can make the prospect of making pizza at home more enjoyable for those who choose to cook in their homes. I have seen an industrial type machine that spreads pizza evenly, but none designed for in-home, more personal use. <br>
<br>
The way I envision the tool working is that there is a center pole with a rotating wing that goes around in a circle spreading the sauce. The center pole goes in the middle of the pizza and the wing that circles around has an adjustable end, which users can adjust to fit the size of their pizza. To enusre that the pizza sauce does not go wider than intended, the end of the wing is bent to limit the edge of the circle to the desired circumference. Users can put a certain amount of sauce in front of the wing and then turn the tool on, starting the spread of the pizza around the dough, letting it spread until even across the pizza.<br>
<br>
I would like the center pole to be as small as possible to ensure that people can spread the sauce around the maximum area of the pizza with as little need to spread the middle as possible. Ideally, I would like to build an attachment to the center pole to make the tool taller and adjustable to whatever one is spreading, such as frosting on a three layer cake. <br>

Here is a simple diagram of what I envision for the tool:
