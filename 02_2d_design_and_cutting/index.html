<h4> My Goals for this Project </h4>

For this week's project, I wanted to construct a house of cards... that wasn't really a house of cards! I enjoy playing cards and wanted to build a structure that played off of the idea of what a House of Cards is, a structure that would be a little more stable than a traditional house of (playing) cards. <br>
<br>

The project started with measuirng the dimensions of actual playing cards, which I did using calipers. Then, I could use those numbers in Fusion360 as the paramaters for my "playing cards." To best ensure that the house would be stable, I needed to have slots into which the ends of the certain cards could fit. Though I initially planned to have an open slot at the top of one card for the end of another card to fit into, Gabby suggested that I have a hole in the cardboard in which the end of another piece could rest flush, to ensure a more stable fit. This turned out to be a far more stable structure than what I'd initially planned. <br>
<br>
Here are what the old cards looked like versus the new cards. The open slot of the old cards made stability very difficult but the closed slot works very well.

The slot of the new cards gave a very nice fit.

<br>

To contstruct a house of cards rather than an open-faced tent of cards, I needed to design three shapes of cards: one with the end piece that could fit through the slot, one with the slot through which I'd put the first piece, and one that could serve as the roof over each individual 2-card house to allow us to build more houses. To ensure better stability, this third piece would fit into slots in the cards rather than having to rest on the sides of the cards. Given that these "roof cards" would be going through the slots of the bottom cards at an angle rather than flush, I made the end pieces of these cards longer than those of the bottom cards. I measured the necessary length of the bottom two cards using an x, x, x√2 equation (as the roof card would lie parallel to the table and the card into which the end of the roof card would go was resting at about a 45 degree angle) in which the length of the roof card (87.39 mm) was my x√2. After the calculations, my x was approximately 61.79 mm and I designed a slot at approximately 61.79 mm up the side of the bottom playing cards through which the end of the roof card could fit. <br>
<br>

The first card (the "A" card) has the end piece that goes through the slot of the "B" card and the larger slot that allows the "C" card to fit through. The "B" card holds both the smaller slot for the A card and the larger slot for the C card. (We can put the end of the C card through the slot in either the A or the B card depedning on the structure we choose for the House of Cards.) The C card only has the two extension pieces (no slots) because it lies horizontally, serving as the roof for the lower "house" and the floor (just as the table does for the first row of houses) for the upper "house(s)." <br>

See the 3 card models below. Notice the slots in both the A and the B card—larger than the slot in the B card—to allow the end of the C card to fit through given that it would be resting at an angle rather than flush (like the A card goes into the B card).

<h4> How We Got Here: Working in Fusion360 </h4>

  Here is an example of the paramaters I'd set for a card.

Once the sketches were all set in Fusion, I extruded them to see what they'd look like with the ~4.6mm thickness of cardboard in solid mode in Fusion, then exported them to the laser cutter to cut.

<h4> A Few of my Structures </h4>

Given that the A card fits into the B card and the C card can fit across the top of an A and B "house," we can build all kinds of neat structures with these cards. Here are a couple that I made. With more cards, we can build more and more unique and interesting houses of cards that we can trust will stay upright!

  <h2> Household Items Sketches </h2>

*I would like to make clear that I completed this part of this week's assignment on Thursday, February 10 (not Tuesday, February 8) and completely understand any penalties that result from this. I also made changes to this website on February 18 (in addition to those I made on March 3).*

For this week's designs, I sketched two somewhat cylindrical objects, a pencil and my water bottle. Given that I plan to incorporate cylindrical designs into my final project, my hope is that getting more familiar with cylindars will help me down the line.  <br>
<br>

<h4> Pencil </h4>
To design my pencil, I designed half of the pencil in 2d and then revolved the design around the center axis to make the pencil a 3d object (many thanks to Chris Zhu for his help with this! Also, [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7ABI9PSjkM) helped me with revolving in Fusion 360 as well. In 2d, I designed the half-cone shaped portion for the wood part with the lead tip at the end (this is the bottom part of the pencil) and a rectangle (which I would revolve around the center axis) for the main body (the part of the pencil we hold to write). I followed the dimensions I took for my pencil, drawing a 20.1 mm line at a 120 degree angle, and then a 171.5 mm, 14 mm, and 5.6 mm line to represent the main body of the pencil, metal bit holding the main body and eraser together, and the eraser, respectively. Given that they all appeared the same after finishing the sketch, I could have just drawn a 191.1 mm line from the corner of the line I drew for the tip of the pencil upwards. Then, using the "Revolve" feature, I selected both lines and revolved the two around the y-axis, which gave me the cone and cylyndrical shapes I'd been hoping to see! Thank you again to Chris!<br>

  Here is my sketch of my pencil in Fusion360 in 2-D.

<h4> My Water Bottle </h4>
To design the water bottle, I also used the revolve feature to design the water bottle in 2d and then revolved it around the center axis to make give the water bottle its shape. The diameter of the bottle for the sketch is about 73.8 mm, though it varies just slightly depending on the where you measure the diameter on the height of the bottle. The height of the main part of bottle is 229.21 mm, and after that, the bottle juts in about 14.635 mm and up about 22.79 mm for the part that you can use to drink. Originally, I designed half of the water bottle (like I did with the pencil) with the plan of revolving it around to shape it. Unfortunately, this would mean that the water bottle was solid! To make the inside of the bottle hollow, I drew lines just inside the edge of the bottle that would make the outside of the bottle very thin and then trimmed away the parts of the bottle between that outside structure and the center axis.
This is what the water bottle looked like in sketch mode (the area between the blue lines represented the body which I'd rotate around the y-axis:

      ![Water bottle in 2d-sketch mode](./water_bottle_2d_sketch.png)
    </div>

I selected the body of the outside of the cylindar and then revolved the body around the y-axis. The payoff was great! The water bottle is hollow inside and, thanks to drawing and filleting multiple lines, the inside of the bottle (closely, though likely not perfectly) follows the shape of the outside of the bottle and is hollow all the way through, conforming to the shape of the bottle.
