  <h1> Week 2: 2D Design and Cutting </h1>

  <h2> Household Items Sketches </h2>

For this week's designs, I sketched two cylindrical objects, a pencil and my water bottle. Given that I plan to incorporate cylindrical designs into my final project, my hope is that getting more familiar with cylindars will help me down the line.  <br>
<br>

<h4> My pencil </h4>
To design my pencil, I broke the pencil down into it's individual parts: the eraser, the metal piece that holds the eraser still, the main body, the wood that buffers between the main body and the lead tip, and the lead tip. I first designed a very small circle to serve as the tip and then sketched up from there. I sketched the two lines representing the wood that buffers between the main body and the lead tip from the origin given that the circle representing the tip was so small. I then drew lines and broke them up to separate out the main body, metal piece that holds the eraser still, and the eraser. <br>

  Here is my sketch of my pencil in Fusion360.

<h4> My pencil </h4>
To design the water bottle, I used a main circle at the bottom as the base of the water bottle and drew up the edges of the circle the height of the main part of the water bottle. Then, because the bottle narrows, I drew lines that led to the outer edges of the smaller circle (using the formula: (big diamater - small diameter) / 2 to get the length of the line I should draw from the edge of the big diameter). I repeated the same process for the smaller nozzle part of the water bottle and rounded the edges using the fillet tool to complete the sketch.

<h4> Making the Structure Work </h4>

The suggestion of having a slot through which I could fit the end of one of the cards helped stability immensely. 
<br>

Here are what the old cards looked like versus the new cards. The open slot made stability very difficult but the closed slot works very well.

Here are pictures of each individual card after coming out of the laster cutter.

    </div>
  </div>

<h4> A Few of my Structures </h4>

Given that the A card fits into the B card and the C card can fit across the top of an A and B "house," we can build all kinds of neat structures with these cards. Here are a couple that I made. With more cards, we can build more and more unique and interesting houses of cards that we can trust will stay upright!
