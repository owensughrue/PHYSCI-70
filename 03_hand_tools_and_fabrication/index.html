<h4> Reason for Doing this Project </h4>

I've always found the movement of oil wells interesting, perhaps because I've never visited Texas and always associate them with a place I've never been that seems to hold a certain mystique for me. I'm certainly a proponent of more sustainable energy practices, though the movement of oil wells has always been interesting to me, reminding me of a horse bending down for water. <br>
<br>
I learned that oil wells are made of up several components, such as the walking beam (the beam that goes up and down), Samson posts (the posts that hold the oil well upright), a crank (which transfers energy from the prime mover to the walking beam), the prime mover (moter), and the horsehead. Many thanks to this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0Dpd52pfp0 for explaining the structure of oil wells. I constructed the Samson posts and walking beam out of wood, using a metal pole through the top of the Samson posts and through the middle of the walking beam to allow the structure to be stable and allow the walking beam to bob up and down. I then attached a crank to the motor to generate the rotational force necessary that the walking beam would take to move up and down. To connect the walking beam to the motor, I used a metal pole that went through the end of the walking beam and connected to a laser cut piece of plastic that would serve as the rotational force once connected to the motor. I also lasercut a little hole in this piece through which I could put the crank, allowing it to connect to the motor and the walking beam. <br>
<br>
I found that the motor moved slower when I put the red wire into the 3.3 rather than 5v slot in the microcontroller and wanted the motor to move relatively slowly to mimc the motion of an oil well. Though the motor still moves a little too fast to be realistic, the basic up and down motion is there.

This would certainly bring up oil pretty quickly, perhaps if it had a few more tons of strength!

<h4> Getting Measurements on the Circuit </h4>

Here is my circuit on the breadboard:

To measure the voltage of the cicuit, I used the multimeter and held the sensors to the resistor and found the voltage to be 3.29 volts. Using Ohm's law to calculate the current, I can use the formula âˆ†V = iR (thanks to https://www.google.com/search?q=ohm%27s+law&oq=ohm&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i57j0i433i512j0i131i433i512l2j0i433i512l2j0i10i131i433i512j0i131i433i512j0i512.5052j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8 for explaining that R stands for resistance). We know that the voltage = 3.29 Volts and the resistance is 10,000 ohms (thanks to https://www.digikey.com/en/resources/conversion-calculators/conversion-calculator-resistor-color-code for helping me calculate the resistance of my resistor). So, we can divide 3.29 / 10,000 to get 3.29x10<sup> -4 </sup> Amperes.

<h4> Final Notes </h4>
Again, I am incredibly sorry that I completed this project late (I finshed it on Tuesday night). I completely understand any pentalites that result from this and will try very hard to make sure I'm on time next week.
Thank you very much to the teaching staff for their help with this project.
